      <description>I used to own Xbox One with Kinect around 5 years ago and had a lot of fun with it. My favorite games back then were Assassins Creed series, Prototype and Dishonored. At first I was thinking what should I buy PS4 or new Xbox? Maybe wait for next generation or fuck it and buy a gaming PC? But all of a sudden I found this &amp;lsquo;cloud gaming&amp;rsquo; thing. I was sceptical at first because milliseconds of latency matter in video games and I get around 40-50 ms to nearest AWS region.</description>
